      <p> 
        At the dawn of the 18th century, the Thirteen Colonies began growing rapidly. Colonists became more adapted to the American landscape, and populations started to grow exponentially. In addition, waves of immigrants
        from England, Ireland, Germany, and other parts of Western Europe  sought new opportunities in 
        this "New World."

        As the American colonies expanded westward, they settled upon disputed territories claimed by both the French and the British. This expansion fueled the territorial dispute, with both powers trying to assert control over the Ohio River Valley. These circumstances, fueled by the French and British's hate for each other, ultimately led to the French and Indian War.

        The French and Indian War was fought between 1754 and 1763. It pitted the British and the American colonists against the French and their Native American allies (hence the name "French and Indian war"). The war resulted in British victory, leading to the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In this treaty, France ceded almost all of its territorial claims to Britain, effectively kicking France out of North America. However, the war also left Britain with a massive debt, leading to increased taxation on the Thirteen Colonies.

        By the mid-18th century, America was a rich mosaic of different cultures. The colonies had become a melting pot of English, Dutch, French, German, African, and Native American influences. These diverse backgrounds shaped a unique American society, influencing language, food, customs, and societal norms.

      <p>During this period, we also saw The Great Awakening - a religious revival that spread throughout the colonies from the 1730s to the 1740s. This movement left a profound impact on the American religious landscape, fostering an independent and personal approach to spirituality that mirrored the growing cultural autonomy of the colonies.</p>

      <p>The Enlightenment, flourishing during the 1700s, was a philosophical movement that emphasized reason, science, and individualism. Enlightenment thinkers advocated for the use of reason to challenge traditional beliefs, such as divine right and absolute monarchy. The movement had a profound impact on the colonists' political beliefs, laying the foundation for concepts such as natural rights, separation of powers, and democracy.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Because of how far away the Thirteen Colonies were from Britain, Britain's trade laws were only loosely enforced in the colonies. This developed into a system called "salutary neglect," in which the colonies 
        were given autonomy as long as they promised to remain loyal to the British Crown. However, after the French and Indian war Britain began exerting more control over the colonies, particulary with taxing the 
        colonists in order to pay for the war. These violations of salutary neglect are credited with galvanizing the colonists towards revolution.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="color">
    <div class="image-container">
      <p>After the French and Indian war, Britain made several violations of salutary neglect that would greatly upset the colonists. The Proclamation Line of 1763 restricted movement beyond the Appalachian Mountains. Then, the Tea Act of 1773 imposed a monopoly on tea trade. Finally, the Intolerable Acts of 1774 punished Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party and shut down Colonial legislatures. These actions infringed upon freedoms that colonists felt they deserved to have, and made many colonists in favor of Revolution.</p>

      <p>The Battle of Lexington and Concord started on April 19, 1775 and is considered the first battle of the Revolutionary War. British troops began marching towards the town of Concord in order to seize weapons that were stashed there. However, the colonists caught wind of this and prepared for their attack. The British faced fierce resistance from militiamen and had to reteat. With shots fired on both sides, the colonies knew that war was inevitable and that independence must be declared. </p>

This was the first government to be used by the colonies. </p>

      <p>When militiamen who served in the continental army came back to their farms, they were met with mountains of debt and taxes that they could not pay. Many of the farmers who risked their lives in the war were upset that they were being faced with this treatment. Led by Daniel Shays, the farmers formed an uprising that would be known as Shays' Rebellion. This uprising would face no opposition from federal troops and would have to be put down by local militia groups. This made many people worry about the future of the country, as without a stronger federal government there was nothing stopping future Daniel Shays's from starting other, potentially-successful uprisings.</p>
